# Contributing

Hey thanks for reading this! It means you're curious about Cedar or want to help
make it better! Here are a couple of ways you can help:

## Commit standard
Any commits sent to the project via PR should follow these guidelines. Changes
will not be merged until they are in this format:

## Triaging

There's so many things to add or fix on top of the normal day to day that it's
easy to let things slip through the cracks. Helping prioritize, update tickets,
or tagging them is a huge help!

## Documentation

Both the code in the compiler and the language itself need documentation on how
they work or how to use them. This will always be the case. Any and all help is
appreciated. Can you translate the existing documentation to another language?
Did you spot a mistake that needs to get fixed up? Send a PR in! Docs are vital
to any project and is an easy way to make a big splash.

## Code

Know Rust and want to fix bugs or add new features? Awesome! Send in a PR! In
the case of adding a new feature please open up a relevant ticket to discuss if
this is something that should be added to Cedar first.

## Conclusion

The fact you want to help out even in a small way by spending your free time on
this project does not go unnoticed. Thank you!
